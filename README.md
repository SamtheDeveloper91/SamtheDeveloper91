- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamtheDeveloper91
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, particularly as it applies to helping companies better understand their customers in order to deliver the most value to them.
- 🏀 Other data-related interests include sports (especially basketball, is the mid-range jumpshot really so bad?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning with Python, Data Visualization with Tableau, and data cleaning and querying with SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve:
        - Gathering a dataset or tidying an existing one
        - Performing exploratory data analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau) and feature engineering
        - Training and tuning a predictive model (SciKit Learn) to produce actionable insights
- 📫 How to reach me: sambudlong7@gmail.com
